# Movie-Recommend-system
A movie recommendation system is important because it helps people find the films they will enjoy the most. Movie recommendation systems use algorithms to analyze a userâ€™s past viewing history, ratings, and likes and dislikes to create a list of films that the user is likely to enjoy. By providing tailored recommendations, users are able to find films that are more relevant to their tastes, rather than having to search through a seemingly endless list of films. This in turn makes it easier for people to discover films they would never have found on their own.
